Hi my name is Shombith and I am an Unity Game Developer. 
I have been wanting to test out some post processing to make a normal game like zigzag look like a pretty aesthetic game.
The Game also uses a soothing soundtrack and also uses unity's procedural level generation and the difficulty shall increase through the level. Game is for now android only.
